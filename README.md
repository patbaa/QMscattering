You may check the presentation at http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/patbaa/QMscattering/blob/master/presentation.ipynb or launch by __jupyter nbconvert --to slides --post serve presentation.ipynb__ . It is the same as the presentation.slides.html file just not a continuous html file but a presentation.

For the code notebook you can check whether here, on github or at http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/patbaa/QMscattering/blob/master/code_and_plotting.ipynb
